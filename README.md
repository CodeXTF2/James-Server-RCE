<h1>James server exploit</h1>
<h2>Exploit written by Ethan Seow (CodeX)</h2>
This is a james server exploit I made for certain ctf challenges where an rbash is spawned via SSH, and the 
James server exploit was used to escape rbash by spawning an unrestricted shell.

This was based on an exploit script made by Jakub.
